/* Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time
taken to make the change, as shown in the following formula:

a = (v1 - v0) / t

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in
meters/second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time span t in
seconds, and displays the average acceleration.

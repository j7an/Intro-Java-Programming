/* Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an
initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user
to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures
of the water. The formula to compute the energy is

       Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184

where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees
Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
